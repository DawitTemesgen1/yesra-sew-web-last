        excerpt: "Navigating the world of government procurement can be tricky. This guide breaks down the process to help your business succeed.",
        content: `
            <p>Government tenders are a massive opportunity for businesses in Ethiopia, but the process can be daunting. Understanding the regulations and requirements is half the battle.</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Get Your Documentation in Order</h3>
            <p>Before you even look at a tender, ensure you have a valid business license, TIN number, and VAT registration. Missing a single document is the most common reason for rejection.</p>

            <p>Don't just apply for everything. Use platforms like Yesra Sew to filter tenders that match your specific capabilities and financial standing.</p>

            <h3>Step 3: The Technical Proposal</h3>
            <p>This is where you show you can do the job. Be detailed, realistic, and follow the format specified in the bid document exactly.</p>

            <p><em>Pro Tip: Always attend the pre-bid meetings if they are offered. You can learn a lot about what the client really wants.</em></p>

        title: "Real Estate Trends in Addis Ababa: Buy or Rent?",
        excerpt: "An in-depth analysis of the property market in Addis Ababa. Is now the right time to invest in a home or should you keep renting?",
        content: `
            <p>Addis Ababa's skyline is changing every day. With new apartments and villas springing up, many residents are asking the same question: Is it better to buy now or continue renting?</p>

            <h3>The Case for Buying</h3>
            <p>Real estate has historically been a hedge against inflation in Ethiopia. Owning a home provides long-term security and an asset that appreciates over time.</p>

            <h3>The Case for Renting</h3>
            <p>With high property prices, renting offers flexibility. It frees up capital that can be invested in businesses or other ventures with potentially higher short-term returns.</p>

            <h3>Market Outlook for 2025</h3>
            <p>Experts predict a stabilization in luxury apartment prices but a continued rise in land value. If you have the capital, buying land remains the gold standard.</p>

        content: `
            <p>Buying a car is a major milestone, but it comes with risks. Whether you are looking at a Vitz or a RAV4, these tips will keep you safe.</p>

            <h3>1. Check the Market Price</h3>
            <p>Prices fluctuate. Check Yesra Sew's car listings to get an average price for the model and year you are interested in.</p>

            <h3>2. The Mechanic Check</h3>
            <p>Never buy without a mechanic you trust. A shiny exterior can hide a damaged engine.</p>

            <h3>3. Verify Ownership</h3>
            <p>Ensure the 'Libre' (title deed) matches the seller's ID exactly. Watch out for complex power of attorney chains.</p>
